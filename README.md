## Introduction

Tellurium is a python environment based on the [Spyder2 IDE](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) 
for building, simulating, and analysing models of biochemical networks, 
including gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks, and signaling pathways. 
It combines state-of-the-art scientific Python libraries, such 
as [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/), 
and includes special-purpose systems biology Python tools. Out of the box, 
Tellurium includes [libRoadRunner](https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner), 
[Antimony](http://antimony.sourceforge.net/), [PhraSED-ML](http://phrasedml.sf.net/), 
[libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) (via its [Python bindings](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML/5.12.0/docs/formatted/python-api/)), and [libSED-ML](https://github.com/fbergmann/libSEDML).

The Tellurium project is funded from the NIH/NIGMS (GM081070).

## Installation Instructions

Tellurium can be installed via a front-end which includes all of its constituent packages, or via `pip`:

1. [Notebook front-end](#front-end-1-tellurium-notebook)
2. [IDE front-end](#front-end-2-tellurium-ide)
3. [pip](#pip-installation-no-front-end)

We recommend first-time users choose one of the front-ends, while developers looking to integrate Tellurium use the pip package. The IDE front-end provides a MATLAB like experience with a code editor and Python console. The notebook front-end provides a notebook interface similar to [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), and features notebook cells for inline OMEX, a human-readable representation of COMBINE archives.

### Front-end 1: Tellurium Notebook

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>
<br style="clear:both"/>

1. [Download Tellurium notebook for Mac OS X 10.10 or later](https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/releases/download/2.0.0-alpha4/Tellurium-2.0.0.dmg)
2. Double-click the .dmg file to open a new window
3. Drag the Tellurium icon to your Applications
4. You can now launch Tellurium from e.g. Spotlight or your Applications folder directly

<img align="left" width="32px" id="debian" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/sys-bio/tellurium/img/debian.png">
<h3>Linux (Debian)</h3>
<br style="clear:both"/>

1. [Download Tellurium notebook for Debian](https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/releases/download/2.0.0-alpha9/Tellurium_2.0.0_amd64.deb)
2. Install the package using `dpkg -i Tellurium_2.0.0_amd64.deb`
3. You should be able to launch Tellurium from your activities pane. If not, log out and in again or run `tellurium` from the terminal.

### Front-end 2: Tellurium IDE

#### Windows

1. [Download Tellurium IDE for Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pytellurium/files/Tellurium-2.0/2.0.0beta/Tellurium-2.0.0beta-Python-2.7-win64-portable-setup-beta.exe/download)
2. Double-click the installer to start the installation
3. Follow the instructions

NOTE: Installation requires administrative rights. It is recommended to accept the default settings.

#### Mac OSX

1. [Download Tellurium IDE for Mac OS X 10.10 or later](https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium/releases/download/1.3.5-rc3/Tellurium-1.3.5-Spyder-2.3.8-OSX.dmg)
2. Double-click the .dmg file to open a new window
3. Double-click the Spyder icon

NOTE: On some older hardware we have noticed that this front-end sometimes fails. If this happens, we recommend using the Tellurium notebook front-end instead.

### PIP Installation (no front-end)

Binaries wheels for Tellurium are available via the `pip` command. To install Tellurium and the necessary packages on both Linux and OS X, type the following into a terminal:

```bash
pip install tellurium
```

Detailed instructions for using the `conda` package manager are available [here.](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/pkgs.html) 

## Usage

```{python}
import tellurium as te

rr = te.loada('''
    model example0
      S1 -> S2; k1*S1
      S1 = 10
      S2 = 0
      k1 = 0.1
    end
''')

result = rr.simulate(0, 40, 500) 
te.plotArray(result)
```

## System Requirements

The Tellurium notebook supports Windows 10, Mac OS X 10.10+, Debian 8+, and Fedora 22+. The [Spyder IDE](https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium#installation-instructions) installers are tested with Windows 7+ and Mac OS X 10.9+. Some older Macs cannot run Spyder, regardless of whether the operating system is up-to-date. Pip packages are tested on Fedora 22, Debian 8, Ubuntu 14.04, and Mac OS X 10.10.

## Supported Python Versions

The Tellurium PyPI packages support 64-bit Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The notebook viewer comes with Python 3.6 (64-bit) and the IDE comes with Python 2.7 (32-bit).
